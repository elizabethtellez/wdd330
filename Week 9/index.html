    <h1>Week 9 Notes</h1>
    <h2> Ch 09 - The Window Object</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It still blows my mind that you can access every global piece of data through the <code>window</code> object.</li>
        <li>Also, something useful that I figured out recently is that if you want to make a function availible to an HTML onclick handler from within an ES6 module, you can assign <code>window.functionName</code> to the function to add it to the global scope.</li>
        <li>Most of the things about the window object in this chapter are things that can just be googled when the occasion requires.</li>
        <li><code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> are pretty cool! Useful for debouncing input and stuff.</li>
        <li>I'm glad they go over <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, it always kills me when people build games and animations with <code>setInterval</code>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2> Ch 14 - HTML APIs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I didn't know that prefixing an attribute with <code>data-</code> makes the browser ignore it! Pretty neat!</li>
        <li>Didn't know there was a 'storage' event!</li>
        <li>I've never had to use the geolocation api's yet, good to know that they're there though!</li>
        <li>Web workers are neat, although I've never had to use them!</li>
        <li>Web sockets are simple in concept, but they're pretty hard to reason about actually.</li>

    </ul>
