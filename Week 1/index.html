    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h2> Reading: Doing Stuff with Web Things</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Something that caught my attention is the difference between Cookies and Local Storage.</li>
      <li>Cookies:  are send to the server in e ach HTTP header</li>
      <li>Information stored or shared – output</li>
      <li>Anything coming from where it was stored or anything user enters – input</li>
      <li>Input-Output – IO</li>
      <li>Section tags – fills up entire width of the rowli</li>
      <li>Local storage – storage within html that can be looked at even after the web page refreshes
        -	uses key-value pairs. Like a phone book, key = name of person, value = phone number
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> MOBILE UX notes from sample</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It is interesting how the web has shifted from being mostly desktop dominated to now being mostly viewed through mobile devices! </li>
      <li>They make a good point that we should be designing for mobile first, since that's where our content is most likely going to be viewed.</li>
      <li>Consolidate your user interfaces. Make common interactions as simple and easy as possible! Fewer steps are better!</li>
      <li>Move important UI elements to the bottom of the screen, that is the spot that is easiest to reach.</li>
      <li>Start with the smallest screens in mind</li>
      <li>Desktops are usually shared in the home</li>
      <li>Mobile devices turnover is very high, every 2 years or so</li>
      <li>Start small and scale up</li>
    </ul>
